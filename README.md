# readable
## Introduction
This project is my implementation of the Readable project. This is the second project of the Udacity React nanodegree program.

## How to start.
### Prerequisites
This is a frontend application. The backend is developed by Udacity and can be aquired [here.](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter)
Plese see the [README.md](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter/blob/master/README.md) file from that project for information on how to deploy and run the server.
You can run this application AFTER the server mentioned above is running. 

#TODO TALK ABOUT PORT OF SERVER

### Running this frontend
Unzip this application into a directory of your choce. I designate this directory as $HOMEDIR. 
Open a terminal and cd into $HOMEDIR/readable. Run the following commands.
```
npm install
npm start
```
The browser will open at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
